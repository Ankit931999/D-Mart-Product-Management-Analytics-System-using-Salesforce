Cleaning the D-Mart Excel file before importing it into Salesforce will ensure data quality and consistency. Here are some parameters you should focus on for optimal data cleaning:

1. Standardize Field Values
Category and Subcategory: Ensure consistent naming (e.g., “Electronics” vs. “electronics”). Use the same capitalization, spelling, and terminology.
Brand: Standardize brand names to avoid duplicates (e.g., “Samsung” vs. “Samsung Inc.”).
Currency: For fields like Price and Discounted Price, ensure values are in the same currency and format (e.g., "$100.00").

2. Remove Duplicates
Identify and remove duplicate entries based on unique fields like Name, Brand, and Category to avoid redundancy.

3. Validate Data Types
Price and Discounted Price: Ensure they contain only numeric values and are formatted consistently (e.g., no extra symbols or spaces).
Quantity: Make sure this is a positive integer, and replace or correct any negative or non-numeric values.

4. Handle Missing or Null Values
Subcategory: If any products are missing subcategories, either assign a default value or leave it blank if the subcategory is truly unknown.
Bread Crumbs and Description: If null, consider adding placeholders, or omit if not critical for initial upload.
5. Check for Logical Consistency
Discounted Price vs. Price: Verify that Discounted Price is always lower than Price.
Quantity: Ensure quantities are accurate (e.g., "Out of Stock" items should have a quantity of zero).
6. Remove Special Characters and Whitespace
Clean up any unnecessary punctuation, symbols, or extra spaces in Name, Descriptions, and Brand fields.
7. Trim Long Text Fields
Fields like Descriptions should be limited to Salesforce’s character limit for text fields, so trim excessive length if needed.
8. Normalize Date Formats (If Applicable)
If any dates are used (e.g., Creation Date), ensure they are in a consistent format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
These steps will ensure the D-Mart dataset is standardized, complete, and consistent before being imported into Salesforce, reducing the risk of data errors and improving usability.
