 Data Management
Data Import: Use Data Import Wizard or Data Loader to load the D-mart dataset into your Salesforce org.
(Note- While using the data import wizard do keep in the mind that mapping of data takes place and the Excel file is edited and all the other values like null, duplicate etc are removed)
Data Validation: Implement validation rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., Price > 0, Quantity >= 0).

Automation: Use Flow Builder or Process Builder to automate tasks such as updating Discounted Price based on predefined rules (e.g., automatic price updates on certain conditions).
